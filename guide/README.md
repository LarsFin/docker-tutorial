# Guide

The guide is currently split into 3 parts, each one looking at separate aspects of docker and how they can be applied to the demonstration applications.

## Parts

These are best tackled in order as they assume knowledge and development from the previous section.

1. [Docker CLI](./1-docker-cli/README.md)
2. [Dockerfiles](./2-dockerfiles/README.md)
3. [Docker Compose](./3-docker-compose/README.md)
